                    After Mangeshkar recorded the hit “Uthaye ja unke sitam” in Andaz (1949), her destiny was sealed. From that point on, she voiced the musical parts for every major leading lady, representing every generation of Bollywood actresses.

                    Lata Mangeshkar was also a music composer and producer. She produced four films: Vaadal (Marathi), Jhaanjhar (Hindi), Kanchan Ganga (Hindi), and Lekin... (Hindi).
